# 🌐 OpenMesh: Open Communication Mesh for AI

**OpenMesh** is a **decentralized, federated communication mesh** for large-scale, open **multi-agent systems (MAS)** such as the **Internet of Agents (IoA)** and the **Society of Agents (SoA)**.  

It provides **topic-routing, pub/sub eventing, per-agent inboxes, typed communication schemas, extensible communication protocols, membership and discovery, and a social-graph overlay** that supports higher-order interaction.  

OpenMesh is **operator-neutral**, **permissionless to join**, and **protocol-extensible**, enabling independent domains to federate while preserving local policy.

---

## ❓Why OpenMesh?

In large-scale open MAS, **communication is the key substrate of intelligence**. Without expressive, reliable, and adaptive communication, agents remain isolated silos, unable to coordinate or form collective behaviors.  

OpenMesh addresses this by ensuring:

- **Coordination of Distributed Action**  
- **Negotiation and Social Contract Formation**  
- **State Sharing and Situation Awareness**  
- **Interoperability and Semantic Alignment**  
- **Emergence of Social Structures**

Unlike centralized, ad hoc, or application-specific systems, OpenMesh **combines resilience, semantic richness, and social awareness** into a single communication fabric.

---

## ⚙️ Core Principles & Features

- **Federated, Operator-Neutral Backbone**  
  Independent relay and directory nodes interoperate via open protocols, preventing lock-in and ensuring resilience.

- **Self-Describing, Schema-Linked Messages**  
  Messages embed schema URIs and semantic identifiers to **validate content, negotiate meaning, and evolve protocols without breakage**.

- **Extensible Protocol Semantics**  
  A minimal set of **performative verbs** (inform, request, propose, agree, etc.) forms a common language, while **protocol packages define richer workflows**

- **Policy-Aware by Design**  
  Enforces domain rules & constraints (access, rate limits, residency, compliance) without fragmenting the network.

- **Partition-Tolerant Survivability Layer**  
  Gossip membership, clustering, and multi-path routing maintain coordination during failures or adversarial conditions.

- **Multi-Pattern Communication Primitives**  
  Unified support for **pub/sub, request–reply, streaming, inbox/mailbox, gossip, shared state boards**, and **social-graph routing**.

- **Social-Graph Overlay**  
  Trust-weighted relationships and attention-routing enable **noise reduction, prioritization, and trust-based communication**.

- **Cross-Protocol Interoperability**  
  Bridges to **HTTP, MQTT, AMQP, Kafka, ROS2**, and others make OpenMesh a universal substrate.

## 📡 Communication Patterns

OpenMesh supports **multi-pattern communication** suited to different tasks and trust contexts:

- **Publish–Subscribe (Pub/Sub)** - Market data, telemetry, collective perception.  
- **Request–Reply** - Resource discovery, queries, contract negotiation.  
- **Streaming Channels** - Continuous feeds, real-time inference, simulation.  
- **Inbox/Mailbox** - Reliable delivery for offline/intermittent agents.  
- **Gossip & Epidemic Dissemination** - Membership, reputation, rapid alerts.  
- **Shared State Boards** - Collaborative state across agents.  
- **Social-Graph–Aware Routing** - Trust/role-weighted routing and filtering.  
- **Pattern Interoperability** - Composite workflows mixing multiple patterns.

## 📜 Semantic Layer & Schemas

OpenMesh ensures **meaning preservation** across heterogeneous agents through:

- **Self-Describing Messages**  
  Each message embeds schema URI, protocol URI, versioning, and security annotations.

- **Distributed Schema Registry**  
  Federated, content-addressable, and replicated across operators to avoid chokepoints. Stores **schemas, protocol definitions, compatibility rules**.

- **Protocol Definitions & State Machines**  
  Support for performative verbs and structured, auditable multi-step workflows that dictate the sequence, conditions, and branching logic of an interaction.

- **Schema & Protocol Negotiation / Translation**  
  On-demand protocol resolution via registries, negotiation, or translator agents. Prevents fragmentation into dialect “islands.”

- **Validation at Ingress & Egress**  
  Enforces schema compliance, protocol safety, and policy adherence for messages at every boundary.

- **Semantic Security**  
  Schema-bound ACLs, protocol enforcement, and type-level controls the meaning and permissible use of messages based on their declared structure, type, and protocol context.
---

## 📞 Signaling, Session Management & Routing

Signaling is the bridge between semantic intent and active communication 

- **Signaling Layer**  
	Used for meta-communication - exchanging information about how to communicate before any actual data is sent. 
  Handles **capability discovery, transport negotiation, security exchange, protocol alignment, and session contracts**.

- **Session Management**  
  Represents a logical communication channel between two or more agents. Establishes and tracks **ephemeral or persistent sessions**, monitors health, enforces policies, and supports graceful or forced termination.

- **Routing Layer**  
  Decides how messages traverse the mesh between agents, balancing performance, security, and compliance. Routing is Policy-aware, trust-sensitive, and adaptive:
  - Direct routing
  - Relay-based routing
  - Multi-path redundancy
  - Trust-weighted path selection
  - Policy-constrained routing (jurisdiction, compliance, SLAs)

- **Routing Metadata**  
  Encodes QoS, trust anchors, geo/policy constraints, and fallback orders.

## Example: Market Coordination Protocol

1. **Buyer publishes RFP** – `market/rfp@v1.0.0`  
2. **Seller responds with proposal** – `market/proposal@v1.0.0`  
3. **Negotiation** – Proposal protocol enforces valid transitions.  
4. **Contract finalization** – `market/contract@v2.0.1` with signatures and clauses.  
5. **Audit & Replay** – All interactions validated, versioned, logged for compliance.
