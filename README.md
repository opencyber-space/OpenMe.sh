# 🚀 Federated Communication System

**A unified, scalable platform for managing and routing messages across distributed services and human interfaces.**  
Modular, policy-driven, and designed for modern cloud-native AI infrastructure.

---

## 🌟 Highlights

### 🧱 Modular Communication Framework
- 📡 Multi-protocol message ingestion (HTTP, WebSocket, Redis, NATS)
- ⚙️ Configurable message routing and policy enforcement
- 💾 Persistent message logging with queryable storage (TimescaleDB)
- 🔄 Real-time message streaming via WebSockets

### 🧠 Intelligent Registry Layer
- 🗂️ Dynamic discovery of communication backbones (ICEs)
- 🌐 Management of deployed systems across multi-cluster networks
- 🩺 Health-aware routing using registry metadata
- 🛡️ Constraint checking for secure and compliant communication

### 🔍 Seamless Observability & Control
- 🔑 Centralized configuration management for topics and systems
- 🧾 Structured queries by message UUID or subject ID
- 🕸️ Comprehensive REST APIs for management and access
- 🛠️ Pluggable human intervention workflows for AI systems
- 🛡️ Dynamic data validation with customizable templates and webhook notifications[1]
